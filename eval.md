# Sorting Suite Evaluation
## Key Takeaways

### Style
- Avoid methods with more than 5 lines (8 is okay for a beginnner)
- Avoid long lines (even in test files!). Break up lines by assigning variables if you have to

### Testing
- Tests should reflect spiraling design: no work case, minimal work case, marginally more work case, normal use case, edge cases

### Organization
- Learn how to set up and use a rake file (what is a 'test task'?)
- Versioning: Learn how to use semantic versioning
